# Tiny-Tetris
Tetris Clone with OLED SSD1306(I2C) for Arduino Nano / Uno

The code is not finished, there is still lots to be done.

Things that need to be added:

High score functionality.

Decent random number generator.

Better key pad control code.

Create a letter font so level etc can be shown.

Tidy up code and optimize for memory, sort out the globals and types.

Create defines for all the magic numbers but they are useful for now.
