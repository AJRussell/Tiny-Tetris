# Tiny-Tetris
Tetris Clone with OLED SSD1306(I2C) for Arduino Nano / Uno

The code is not finished, there is still lots to be done.

Things that need to be added:

High score functionality.

Decent random number generator.

Better key pad control code.

Create a font so level etc can be shown.

Tidy up code and optimize for memory.
